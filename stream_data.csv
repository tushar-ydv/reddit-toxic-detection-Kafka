Molecular interactions between proteins and a molecule of interest, lets say a potential drug, could be simulated now at this high level of accuracy (remember proteins can be a few hundred atoms to hundreds of millions of atoms and they exist in a solvent that affects how they fold). These interactions help screen whether a new potential drug is promising or not before it’s made. But truly the use cases is vast. This simulation can be used to calculate mechanical properties of a material, electrical properties, optical properties and so on.

For all the miracles the internet has given us, it's also thrown the balance of our whole civilization out of whack.

It decimated so many industries - mainly those based on the viability of physical media like movies, music, video games, literature, and print journalism - which created a slew of horrible knock-on effects as companies got more desperate and, uh, ""creative"" about monetizing their products. In the 90's, engaging with any of those things as a consumer felt pretty straightforward: They make things, and if you want those things, you pay a fair price to get them, and then you own them. Now, it feels like every media company is trying to lure you in with something strangely addictive and often ""free"", and then tricking you into paying for it, repeatedly, for as long as possible.

My poor amygdala has been at DEFCON 1 for so long that even just easing back a little is a big deal; it’s fucking exhausting.

mq3isz0,politics,Prior_Coyote_4376,"Harris said she wouldn’t do things differently than Biden. She promised to keep the status quo that people had been rejecting since Obama. Pushing things like “joy” and ignoring their top-performing ads about grocery prices made her seem out of touch with people and the urgency they want to see towards problems in their daily lives.

The “they/them” ad was effective because it took advantage of Dems not having a clear agenda for change, leaving an opening for the right to lie about DEI. In that ad, Harris is ironically being much clearer about what she supports and why than her usual answers. 

“25k down payment assistance for first generation homebuyers” doesn’t really communicate much. It’s not a policy that addresses the cause of a problem. Why is housing expensive in the first place? Trump lies and says immigrants or globalism, but people know what his stance is. Compare that to “universal gender affirming care” and it’s easy to see why one sticks. 

Most people really aren’t paying attention to politics closely and don’t think most of it seriously until it affects them. It’s easy to blame the voters for it, but that’s not an excuse for us not to adapt. She should have run as a prosecutor who would use the government to declare war on corruption in corporate America, leaning into the populist desire for reform while holding the elites accountable for a rigged system. She could easily have compared businesses and cartels with her experience. 

Instead she says most businesses are doing their best for consumers and only a few “bad apples” are the problem. Now look at all of them kissing Trump’s ring. She cozied up to Wall Street and wanted to be more business-friendly than Biden, and lost an opportunity for a very strong rebuttal to Trump’s corruption.",1,clean

A couple of years ago, I felt one of the most excruciating pains ever and thought it was related to my achalasia (have had 2 surgeries so far, everything's okay now). When it hit the 5 hour mark, I asked my parents to take me to the hospital. I couldn't even talk to the doctor thanks to the pain I was feeling, so my mother explained what happened to him. Bless her heart, she mentioned I have struggled with anxiety for years. He dismissed my symptoms and told me to have something for the pain. The next night, I ended up in the ER again. Dismissed once more with an injection for the pain. The third day, we went to a different doctor and he finally ran some tests (blood work and ultrasounds) to confirm if I had something related to my gallbladder, as I mentioned the pain was in my upper abdomen, like a belt tightening around it. He was right, my whole gallbladder was calcified thanks to years of hormonal medication (that I had to stop taking because the side effects made me suicidal and in constant pain, plus they only masked my symptoms). So, I've learned to avoid mentioning my anxiety whenever I feel something is wrong with my body. 

Fun fact! The same thing happened when I was diagnosed with achalasia as a kid: weeks of gastritis treatment, doctors telling my parents I possibly was bulimic (at 9 years old) or simply a picky eater. No one decided to run tests to make sure everything was okay with my esophagus and stomach until I had lost several kilos and couldn't even drink water.",1,clean

I live on the west coast, but near the end of 1998 my family took a trip to Washington DC. We went on tours of all the big Washington DC staples, the White House, the Library of Congress, the Lincoln Memorial etc. 

When touring the Capitol building (I think, I was young and don't remember where this specific was) our tour guide got really excited because we had a ""rare"" opportunity to get to see the office of the speaker of the house who was at the time Newt Gingrich. Apparently this didn't happen often and we were given all these very strict rules about what we could and couldn't do while we were in there, because it was actually Newt Gingrich's office and he would be returning later that day. 

Everyone was well behaved and excited, and the tour guide started giving us this really empassioned speech about the history of the office and it's significance. Then  there was a smell, slow building at first, but it got worse and worse by the second. I mean it smelled like some one had been consuming rotting skunk carcasses, and it had given them explosive diarrhea. It way eye watering and dare I say somehow ""spicy"" at the same time. Our tour guide actually stopped mid sentence and cut her speech short so we could all leave which everyone who had only moments ago been so excited to get into the room were basically clamoring to get out. 

I knew the source of this smell well. My little brother for whatever reason had gone through a phase where for like 2 years straight, he would just lay the nastiest farts. We actually had taken him to the doctor on a couple occasions, because we were convinced there was something medically wrong with him. But this particular one took the cake. To this day it was the worst smell I have ever smelled.

The kicker to this all was almost exactly two weeks later, to the day, Newt Gingrich unexpectedly resigned as speaker of the house. My family all jokes that this was a direct result of this nasty fart.",1,toxic

Mom was floored that he'd done this and wondered if he'd ever actually interacted with children before.  Even if I *hadn't* understood the terminology, I sure as hell knew what the word ""risks"" meant.  He'd simply spoken in front of me as if I was a potted plant or something.

After I freaked the hell out as they were attempting to actually administer the anaesthesia because I basically thought my heart and lungs were about to stop, the doctor apologized to my mother and said he'd exercise more discretion in how he spoke in front of young children in the future.

Mom figured with kids older than toddlerhood, either they're young enough that it's better for them not to hear it at all in which case you don't say it in front of them, or else if they're old enough, children deserve to be told directly the same as adults.

It's all so damned dismissive.  

You were a full-on *adult,* who those assholes just decided didn't need to be informed of anything as you were dying and they were performing or not performing tests and procedures.  Why worry her pretty little head about it?  Ugh.  That's *so* much more terrifying than actually being kept informed and given any damned agency.  That's horrifying.  I'm so sorry, you deserved much, much better than that treatment.",1,toxic

If I can qualify her comment on her behalf- she meant this in the context of the discussion, which was about whether juries are still relevant in this time of very dense scientific evidence, and whether they can understand and process this evidence. So she meant that most of the time scientific evidence is presented in a way that most juries understand and draw reasonable conclusions from that presentation.

For the record, I still think the average person is not equipped for questioning what “experts” say in court. However, the average person is not the average juror, because jurors skew older and from more economically comfortable situations. She (lawyer) knows jurors better than I (non-lawyer) do, which is what adds weight to her comment for me.",1,clean

We got on the hot tub and friends girlfriend ""tripped"" when she entered and grabbed my cock. Everyone laughed it off, but I was weirded out. After we all went inside, I went off and sat on a couch with only a towel. Closed my eyes to get some sleep as it was around 1am and I was drunk, when I felt my towel being removed. Opened my eyes and my friends gf was naked and trying to get to my cock. I had to push her back for what felt like ten minutes as I could hear her bf talking in the other room.

And to be clear - he is a narcissist psychopath, I’m not denying that. Im just saying by doing the 3 points above, it goes far beyond narcissism and is a tactic to change the reality around him and public perception - and obviously it has worked for him his whole career, which requires a narcissistic psychopath to successfully pull off.

>At a Wednesday Cabinet meeting, Trump gushed over Musk, reassuring him that he had been “treated unfairly, but the vast majority of people in this country really respect and appreciate you, and this whole room can say that very strongly,” noting that he has “really been a tremendous help.” 

Lie #1: ""You have to have a thick skin to succeed in business.""

A Cabinet-level meeting was held to coddle Musk's feelings because he felt bad after people laughed at him for being an attention-seeking Nazi as he destroyed the US government and consigned thousands of innocent people around the world to undeserved disease, hardship, and death. Tissue is tough compared to this loser's thin skin. 

Lie #2: ""Business is nimble and moves quickly compared to government!""

There was talk of people souring on the Tesla brand because of Musk's antics even before the election. And yet even now, the company's official position is that they are doing nothing to rein him in, even after he caused a 71% earnings dive. I live in Japan, a country whose government is famous for dithering, and even here I have never seen a government do as little in the face of such an obvious crisis as Tesla is doing to deal with Musk.",1,toxic

Potential parents might have a flexible timeframe to become parents, but children don't have the same luxury; they are growing up whether they have parents or not, so we should do as much as we can to give them the best possibility of making that happen.

however there is one piece of advice that i feel like is super easy to follow, doesnt require a big ass personality change, also doesn't require a lot of work, can be done right now, and garners a lot of positive attention. the only thing is you have to constantly be aware about it until its natural for you......and that is having a confident and purposeful walk. infact, this alone can actually lead you into having confidence, ambition, being attractive, help your social ability, etc....

this was a game changer for me. when i was younger like up to the 1st year of college i would slouch when i walk, very lazy walk like i walked with no purpose and shit even if i did have something i needed to do. i was never aware of it. sometime in my early 20s i got obsessed with how certain celebrities/athletes/artists walked and carried themselves, and im like, shit i need to walk like that. not too long after it became natural to me and i didnt even think about it. girls actually started hitting on me and people showed interest in me. the funny thing is im not even tall (5'6) and people were actually showing genuine interest in me. im actually hella goofy and carefree and shit but my ex told me that i look intimidating to approach because i of how i carry myself.

so yes, young men, please be aware of how you walk. you walk a majority of the day and its one thing that can project personal confidence without having to actually do anything. just dont over do it, dont try to walk like a model or some shit, you have to find the right balance and for me that took months to years.",1,clean

Most gals who are Cuckqueans are more into hot-husbanding moreso than trying than trying to find a bull and do the whole ""rub your face in it,"" sort of thing.  If a gal is into the humiliation bit she's probably already running in BDSM circles and has a Dom who can accommodate more than trying to find a piece of cake on their own.

And it's hard enough to find Cake more or less find gal who is going to enjoy too much in the way of humiliating the wife without paying for it.

Most guys who are bulls get burnt out on cuckhold play pretty quickly.  Even with good communication and boundaries it can feel dehumanizing for the folks involved.

I'd say it's easier to find a bi or heteroflexible unicorn as an attractive n good at flirting couple than it is to get third who likes exhibitionism and is okay being third wheel  but not more involved poly.

He’s also charismatic, for better or worse, which makes me think he understands people generally and public perception so for him to be totally unaware of what he’s doing I think is just incorrect.

I just hate how people call him a dumb narcissist, while at the same time he’s able to convince half the country he’s a brilliant 8=D chess player. His tactics work and a straight narcissist couldn’t do that, but a charismatic one with specific rules of “how to be a strongman” make more sense. So I don’t think he’s very dumb when it comes to people and public perception, it’s the economics, “it’s computer”, and other areas of “expertise” that he’s rightfully called out as being an idiot for but simply denying something doesn’t exist is actually “smart” simply because it works.

mq3m2b4,AskReddit,muhhuh," April, 2008. Easter Sunday. 

Been having a bad year so far. My ex took off and left me with a house that we just bought the previous year. I couldn’t afford the house without working two jobs. Spring thaw came around and flooded the basement bad enough to render the house almost unlivable. I managed to hold things together the best I could. My life was in shambles, my unlivable house was in the process of foreclosing because insurance didn’t cover the water infiltration, and I had to be at a family get-together for Easter. 

I woke up and bird bathed because I didn’t have hot water. Water heater was under water in the basement. It was cold. Furnace was under water too. It was tough rolling out of bed. I put on my happy mask and went to the family function to get berated by my pretentious, spoiled cousins and my bitch aunt. Had a cup of coffee after brunch. 

Got the hell out of there and started my way “home” to the shithole house. Remembered that I didn’t poop before I left the house. It was only about a half hour drive, so I can make it. 

Turned on to my street and felt that I couldn’t, in fact, make it. 

I was driving a four cylinder S-10 pickup. It wasn’t the fastest thing in the world, but that son of a bitch did 100mph going down my country road. Got about 1/4 mile from my house and all hell broke loose. Full-on shit my pants at 100mph. I slowed to the speed limit and hovered the seat the best I could while driving a manual transmission. Not an easy task. 

I waddled in to the house and cried, then took a stone cold shower to clean myself up.

There was random drug testing carried out on my base, but these tests had to have transport pre-booked so that if anyone tested positive in the field test, their sample could be taken directly to pathology for confirmatory testing. Because I worked in transport, I could see when these were booked and made sure to be somewhere off-base at that time.

I asked him if study of Zen and meditation would help and his answer was ""Gee, I dunno, but I will tell you that if you meditate and study Zen long enough, in time........you just won't mind"".   
Liked the response and started. Every day.   
Its been 51 years of daily meditation and I haven't missed a day.   
Its been a real help in my life in a lot of ways.   
Oh, and the hand shaking went away in two weeks after I started to meditate, and never returned. 

In Zen we don't really care much about rebirth or reincarnation. Its a feature but we don't spend much time thinking about it. We do discipline ourselves to learn to focus on the present, as that is the only place where change happens. You can forget the past, its gone.......and you can plan for but don't have to worry much about the future, because its unknowable and never happens the way you think it will. 

You are right about the rebirth aspect.   
There is no Creator God in Buddhism, so there is no heaven or hell or sin.

How familiar are you really with Galileo?


Galileo, was right in his conclusion. He was wrong in his science, literally. It's kind of funny he is ironically held up by atheists often. 


As you see the Pope actually summoned him and liked his ideas. The Pope asked him to right the ideas etc. 


Those who disagreed with him were the scientists far more than clergy. And in truth, his science was wrong. 


The scientific consensus was that Galileo was wrong. At the time then, by the same metrics used by today to declare what is truth, Galileo was a pseudo science charlatan. And the other scientists pooed on him. 


Galileo then basically became a disgruntled scientist and:


>tells the story in such a way to make the other person look like an idiot. 


That's when he got in trouble. 


The fault of the Pope was actually in that the Pope was more like a modern atheist via science, then a theist. 


The Pope was told that Galileo was debunked and that he was rowdy and spoke wrong. So the Pope told him so. Then Galileo went at the Pope (who at the time was also the King of the country that Galileo lived in etc). 


His ""house arrest"" wasn't a bars and lock down, but a banning from academia. 


Galileo is the poster child not of atheist scientists, but of everyone atheist scientists hate. 


While Galileo was literally and thus autistically wrong... he was intrinsically right. 


>Science has not discovered a purpose to life, but it makes no claim as to


Science does not really ""do"" anything other than be intrinsically correct. 


But we are humans in a lived human experience. We don't talk to ""science"", we talk to humans known as scientists. 


90? 99?% of what is termed ""science"" is not SCIENCE. The inanimate thing. But is ""the scientific consensus."" 


When defending ""science"" that is really the scientific consensus, atheists say what science, the inanimate object is, or try to. 


Interestingly, what is another set of similar words to ""the scientific consesus?"" 


""The theologian consensus."" Doesn't theology intrinsic make either does it? Everything most people know of things are the consensus, not the intrinsic thing.  


Back to the math, pemdas is not intrinsic math, it's a mathematical consensus, a language. But not math itself. 


Dude in the video, firstly it's an 18 min gee whiz. Summarizes thousands of hours of concept. The expectation of perfection is beyond a sense of the silly. 


Further, let's go back to Galileo, if Galileo was less of a ""dick"", he might have been able to be less egotistical, maybe refine his errant science to better prove his conclusions. But that's not how humans do. 


Sheldrake for instance, is a scientist, who was similarly treated to Galileo. Right or wrong, being a human, he reacted like humans do. 


Grains of salt all around, Galileo or Sheldrake, right or wrong, their earnest inquisition and thoughts are met with vitriol. In reality, by the clergy of ""science"". Aka scientists or people who proport to represent science or have power in science. 


One thing though is you notice perhaps at least some humility. In that he gives these things to a question, rather than a statement of fact. Which is what science is. But a question is not allowed often. In science intrinsic? Of course. By the ""gatekeepers?"" Errr not so much. 


Every one of his points and conclusions in terms of the intrinsic could be wrong and he wouldn't be wrong about the ""consensus"" team. 


I noted that the Bible does not say the sun was made after the earth, but rather light was. 


The general ""clergy consensus"" among Christians is that it was. They are wrong, but that doesn't mean the biblical bit there is wrong. 


Science by defintion in root can never be wrong. But it's clergy, it's adherents etc can often be quite wrong, arrogant, ego driven, hostile, violent etc. Because, they are humans, not science. 


>Or have I pegged you entirely wrong, and you're actually only 51% sure of the existence of god, souls, and angels, and you find the rest highly debatable? I don't think from what you've said that you feel that way, but I'm just making sure.


Using the modern variation of not being trapped by language, I 100% beleive in Kami... singular, plural, big, small, as my English speaker said ""a meaningless word...."" but with meaning. 


For the human mind at least, **language crafts reality, a limited language limits the reality you can have. Unlimited language afford the totality of reality.**


Hence in part the math. Unlimited math. 


They say math is ""the Universal language"" but if your math is limited by language, you may not see the Universal math from another. Meeting an alien doing math in a different math language, not just ""language"" may make you not understand the thing that should be Universal. 


>Which is to say that god exists, and that god communicates with us? Is that the only high confidence belief you take from the entire Christian cannon? Or does that also include key events like the resurrection and possibly the global flood? Does your confidence include key events from other religions, since you seem to find them compatible on some level?


Generally? Yes? Lol. 


Different levels of the % per se. Many in discernment. But also, language. 


Not being contained by limited language, a thing can be many things simultaneously in a way. 


What is a ""cool shirt."" Is it cold? Is it hip? Is it cool like party people cool? Is is cool like ""neat/mildly interesting?"" 


If you apply one of these errantly and beleive it wholly, crafting your reality, then you may think when someone proves the shirt wasn't cold... that the shirt was disproven. But, you're just lacking any understandings. 


>My main focus here is still linked to the root question of what makes someone like yourself confident not only that god exists,


As I thought you sort of touched on earlier. Perhaps the answer is:


""The study of everything."" 


There is no answer, there is all the answers. There is the totality of reality? Every science, every discipline, every philosophy, every concept. None in isolation, but the whole of it put together. 


Limited language or limited things, are... necessarily limited. They are necessarily incomplete, lacking in the whole. 


To seek an isolated or even small answer to the totality of all things, is a nonsequitor is it not? Is not the answer to the totality of all things, the totality of all things? 


If an apple in the end is only truly known by knowing an apple, how else could we know of the total without knowing as much of the total as possible?

""I haven't seen you in a minute!"", what does that phrase mean? ""I have not seen you in 60 seconds""?????

The question is good here, a ""global"" flood. I lean toward such, yes. But it's not really required outside of that pesky autism. A large flood would fit the mold. 


The autistic would require 60 seconds of unseen. The human understands that the minute is not 60 seconds. Maybe, sometimes it is, but it is not actually intrinsic to it. 


As I said too, Kami, Elohim, etc were all translated later into different words in different places with more autistic languages, more limited language models, more crafting models. 


To understand how people speak... kind of like I mentioned both Biden and Trump, they speak Archaic. And thus they are no longer understood in some (many) circles. Even when not just falsely misunderstood due to division. They speak more human, we do not anymore. So what is anything when a human speaks? And what is it when a robot speaks? They are not the same.

Using them as a source as if they are somehow tapped into the Democratic machine despite consistently downplaying Trump and overplaying anything even remotely resembling a scandal from Democrats to keep the horse race going is consistent evidence of this.

Basically the issue here is, you THINK you're getting word from ""Democratic insiders"" when in reality you're just listening to what the right-wing say about Democrats, which is really the biggest problem within the American electorate in general. Right-wing media flood the zone with so much bullshit and encompass so much across the spectrum that there effectively is no real ""Democratic"" media or any media that accurately represents Democrats because even the ones the right call ""left-wing"" media are actually owned, operated by and dictated to BY the right-wing.

One of the biggest cons the right has managed over the last 30-40 years is convincing people that they're somehow the underdog in the media when in fact they've always either through manipulation or outright control been able to essentially give conservatives the advantage of play in any conversation, and what that ultimately translates to is that dishonesty I mentioned. One of the greatest and most common lies from the right is that the left dominate the media and the conversation.",1,0.1711309523809524,clean
mq3n4mr,politics,jewish_insider,"Here is the beginning of the story:

Speaking on Wednesday at an event organized by the Vandenberg Coalition, Sen. Jim Banks (R-IN) attempted to lay out a middle path forward for conservative foreign policy balancing elements of the internationalism that has long dominated the party and the more restrictionist sentiments that have been ascendant in the Trump era.

The first-term Indiana senator argued that the U.S. has critical interests in the Middle East, in countering the threat from Iran and supporting Israel, even as he leaned into elements of President Donald Trump’s foreign policy that are controversial among Republican traditionalists. He framed that policy as a return to a Reaganite peace through strength approach.

Banks said that the U.S. “cannot accept another bad deal with Iran,” adding that he does not believe Trump would be interested in returning to a deal similar to the Obama-era Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.

Iran, Banks argued, is its weakest position in decades and “the president knows that he holds all the cards, and he knows how to play them. He is also the most pro-Israel president that we’ve ever had, so I fully expect him to put America and Israel’s interests first when it comes to dealing with Iran.”",1,0.09333333333333334,clean

The United States, Canada, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Western European countries and other allies represented the ""First World"", while the Soviet Union, China, Cuba, North Korea, Vietnam, and their allies represented the ""Second World"". This terminology provided a way of broadly categorizing the nations of the Earth into three groups based on political divisions. Due to the complex history of evolving meanings and contexts, there is no clear or agreed-upon definition of the Third World.

Molecular interactions between proteins and a molecule of interest, lets say a potential drug, could be simulated now at this high level of accuracy (remember proteins can be a few hundred atoms to hundreds of millions of atoms and they exist in a solvent that affects how they fold). These interactions help screen whether a new potential drug is promising or not before it’s made. But truly the use cases is vast. This simulation can be used to calculate mechanical properties of a material, electrical properties, optical properties and so on.

The companies that produce hardwood in the US primarily supply large cabinet and moulding suppliers, and use the excess pulp for their own engineered wood products.

For all the miracles the internet has given us, it's also thrown the balance of our whole civilization out of whack.

It decimated so many industries - mainly those based on the viability of physical media like movies, music, video games, literature, and print journalism - which created a slew of horrible knock-on effects as companies got more desperate and, uh, ""creative"" about monetizing their products. In the 90's, engaging with any of those things as a consumer felt pretty straightforward: They make things, and if you want those things, you pay a fair price to get them, and then you own them.

mq3isz0,politics,Prior_Coyote_4376,"Harris said she wouldn’t do things differently than Biden. She promised to keep the status quo that people had been rejecting since Obama. Pushing things like “joy” and ignoring their top-performing ads about grocery prices made her seem out of touch with people and the urgency they want to see towards problems in their daily lives.

The “they/them” ad was effective because it took advantage of Dems not having a clear agenda for change, leaving an opening for the right to lie about DEI. In that ad, Harris is ironically being much clearer about what she supports and why than her usual answers. 

“25k down payment assistance for first generation homebuyers” doesn’t really communicate much. It’s not a policy that addresses the cause of a problem. Why is housing expensive in the first place? Trump lies and says immigrants or globalism, but people know what his stance is. Compare that to “universal gender affirming care” and it’s easy to see why one sticks. 

Most people really aren’t paying attention to politics closely and don’t think most of it seriously until it affects them. It’s easy to blame the voters for it, but that’s not an excuse for us not to adapt. She should have run as a prosecutor who would use the government to declare war on corruption in corporate America, leaning into the populist desire for reform while holding the elites accountable for a rigged system. She could easily have compared businesses and cartels with her experience. 

Instead she says most businesses are doing their best for consumers and only a few “bad apples” are the problem. Now look at all of them kissing Trump’s ring. She cozied up to Wall Street and wanted to be more business-friendly than Biden, and lost an opportunity for a very strong rebuttal to Trump’s corruption.",1,toxic,0.001

A couple of years ago, I felt one of the most excruciating pains ever and thought it was related to my achalasia (have had 2 surgeries so far, everything's okay now). When it hit the 5 hour mark, I asked my parents to take me to the hospital. I couldn't even talk to the doctor thanks to the pain I was feeling, so my mother explained what happened to him. Bless her heart, she mentioned I have struggled with anxiety for years. He dismissed my symptoms and told me to have something for the pain. The next night, I ended up in the ER again. Dismissed once more with an injection for the pain. The third day, we went to a different doctor and he finally ran some tests (blood work and ultrasounds) to confirm if I had something related to my gallbladder, as I mentioned the pain was in my upper abdomen, like a belt tightening around it. He was right, my whole gallbladder was calcified thanks to years of hormonal medication (that I had to stop taking because the side effects made me suicidal and in constant pain, plus they only masked my symptoms). So, I've learned to avoid mentioning my anxiety whenever I feel something is wrong with my body. 

Fun fact! The same thing happened when I was diagnosed with achalasia as a kid: weeks of gastritis treatment, doctors telling my parents I possibly was bulimic (at 9 years old) or simply a picky eater.

I live on the west coast, but near the end of 1998 my family took a trip to Washington DC. We went on tours of all the big Washington DC staples, the White House, the Library of Congress, the Lincoln Memorial etc. 

When touring the Capitol building (I think, I was young and don't remember where this specific was) our tour guide got really excited because we had a ""rare"" opportunity to get to see the office of the speaker of the house who was at the time Newt Gingrich. Apparently this didn't happen often and we were given all these very strict rules about what we could and couldn't do while we were in there, because it was actually Newt Gingrich's office and he would be returning later that day. 

Everyone was well behaved and excited, and the tour guide started giving us this really empassioned speech about the history of the office and it's significance. Then  there was a smell, slow building at first, but it got worse and worse by the second. I mean it smelled like some one had been consuming rotting skunk carcasses, and it had given them explosive diarrhea. It way eye watering and dare I say somehow ""spicy"" at the same time. Our tour guide actually stopped mid sentence and cut her speech short so we could all leave which everyone who had only moments ago been so excited to get into the room were basically clamoring to get out. 

I knew the source of this smell well. My little brother for whatever reason had gone through a phase where for like 2 years straight, he would just lay the nastiest farts. We actually had taken him to the doctor on a couple occasions, because we were convinced there was something medically wrong with him. But this particular one took the cake. To this day it was the worst smell I have ever smelled.

The kicker to this all was almost exactly two weeks later, to the day, Newt Gingrich unexpectedly resigned as speaker of the house. My family all jokes that this was a direct result of this nasty fart.",1,toxic,0.001

mq3izvs,politics,KrookedDoesStuff,">> Minutes into his speech, Trump mentioned his faith advisers’ work in the White House. “No other president allowed that. They said, 'separation between church and state.' I said, ‘Alright, let's forget about that for one time.’”

mq3izy3,AskReddit,PinkNGreenFluoride,"When I was 10 (and looked even younger), I needed an MRI.  Had to be sedated for it, as otherwise I was not physically capable of staying still - that's *why* I needed the MRI.

Doc came in with documents for Mom to sign before we left to go to the procedure room, and started dryly explaining risks of anaesthesia right in front of me.  Mom realized what he was doing and tried to get him to stop and move the conversation out of the room.  Yeah, too late.

He assumed such a little kid know what any of that meant if he used the big words like ""cardiopulmonary.""  I read encyclopedias in her spare time and had a particular interest in the home medical encyclopedias my grandmother had given Dad.  This man had my rapt attention and I understood every word.  I was old enough and educated enough to understand what the words meant, but too young to really understand the *level* of risk, that this is a routine and safe procedure.

Mom was floored that he'd done this and wondered if he'd ever actually interacted with children before.  Even if I *hadn't* understood the terminology, I sure as hell knew what the word ""risks"" meant.  He'd simply spoken in front of me as if I was a potted plant or something.

After I freaked the hell out as they were attempting to actually administer the anaesthesia because I basically thought my heart and lungs were about to stop, the doctor apologized to my mother and said he'd exercise more discretion in how he spoke in front of young children in the future.

Mom figured with kids older than toddlerhood, either they're young enough that it's better for them not to hear it at all in which case you don't say it in front of them, or else if they're old enough, children deserve to be told directly the same as adults.

It's all so damned dismissive.  

You were a full-on *adult,* who those assholes just decided didn't need to be informed of anything as you were dying and they were performing or not performing tests and procedures.  Why worry her pretty little head about it?  Ugh.  That's *so* much more terrifying than actually being kept informed and given any damned agency.  That's horrifying.  I'm so sorry, you deserved much, much better than that treatment.",1,toxic,0.011

If I can qualify her comment on her behalf- she meant this in the context of the discussion, which was about whether juries are still relevant in this time of very dense scientific evidence, and whether they can understand and process this evidence. So she meant that most of the time scientific evidence is presented in a way that most juries understand and draw reasonable conclusions from that presentation.

For the record, I still think the average person is not equipped for questioning what “experts” say in court. However, the average person is not the average juror, because jurors skew older and from more economically comfortable situations.

Lie #1: ""You have to have a thick skin to succeed in business.""

A Cabinet-level meeting was held to coddle Musk's feelings because he felt bad after people laughed at him for being an attention-seeking Nazi as he destroyed the US government and consigned thousands of innocent people around the world to undeserved disease, hardship, and death. Tissue is tough compared to this loser's thin skin. 

Lie #2: ""Business is nimble and moves quickly compared to government!""

There was talk of people souring on the Tesla brand because of Musk's antics even before the election. And yet even now, the company's official position is that they are doing nothing to rein him in, even after he caused a 71% earnings dive.

however there is one piece of advice that i feel like is super easy to follow, doesnt require a big ass personality change, also doesn't require a lot of work, can be done right now, and garners a lot of positive attention. the only thing is you have to constantly be aware about it until its natural for you......and that is having a confident and purposeful walk. infact, this alone can actually lead you into having confidence, ambition, being attractive, help your social ability, etc....

this was a game changer for me. when i was younger like up to the 1st year of college i would slouch when i walk, very lazy walk like i walked with no purpose and shit even if i did have something i needed to do. i was never aware of it. sometime in my early 20s i got obsessed with how certain celebrities/athletes/artists walked and carried themselves, and im like, shit i need to walk like that. not too long after it became natural to me and i didnt even think about it. girls actually started hitting on me and people showed interest in me. the funny thing is im not even tall (5'6) and people were actually showing genuine interest in me. im actually hella goofy and carefree and shit but my ex told me that i look intimidating to approach because i of how i carry myself.

so yes, young men, please be aware of how you walk. you walk a majority of the day and its one thing that can project personal confidence without having to actually do anything. just dont over do it, dont try to walk like a model or some shit, you have to find the right balance and for me that took months to years.",1,toxic,0.019

Most gals who are Cuckqueans are more into hot-husbanding moreso than trying than trying to find a bull and do the whole ""rub your face in it,"" sort of thing.  If a gal is into the humiliation bit she's probably already running in BDSM circles and has a Dom who can accommodate more than trying to find a piece of cake on their own.

And it's hard enough to find Cake more or less find gal who is going to enjoy too much in the way of humiliating the wife without paying for it.

Most guys who are bulls get burnt out on cuckhold play pretty quickly.  Even with good communication and boundaries it can feel dehumanizing for the folks involved.

I'd say it's easier to find a bi or heteroflexible unicorn as an attractive n good at flirting couple than it is to get third who likes exhibitionism and is okay being third wheel  but not more involved poly.

I just hate how people call him a dumb narcissist, while at the same time he’s able to convince half the country he’s a brilliant 8=D chess player. His tactics work and a straight narcissist couldn’t do that, but a charismatic one with specific rules of “how to be a strongman” make more sense.

mq3m2b4,AskReddit,muhhuh," April, 2008. Easter Sunday. 

Been having a bad year so far. My ex took off and left me with a house that we just bought the previous year. I couldn’t afford the house without working two jobs. Spring thaw came around and flooded the basement bad enough to render the house almost unlivable. I managed to hold things together the best I could. My life was in shambles, my unlivable house was in the process of foreclosing because insurance didn’t cover the water infiltration, and I had to be at a family get-together for Easter. 

I woke up and bird bathed because I didn’t have hot water. Water heater was under water in the basement. It was cold. Furnace was under water too. It was tough rolling out of bed. I put on my happy mask and went to the family function to get berated by my pretentious, spoiled cousins and my bitch aunt. Had a cup of coffee after brunch. 

Got the hell out of there and started my way “home” to the shithole house. Remembered that I didn’t poop before I left the house. It was only about a half hour drive, so I can make it. 

Turned on to my street and felt that I couldn’t, in fact, make it. 

I was driving a four cylinder S-10 pickup. It wasn’t the fastest thing in the world, but that son of a bitch did 100mph going down my country road. Got about 1/4 mile from my house and all hell broke loose. Full-on shit my pants at 100mph. I slowed to the speed limit and hovered the seat the best I could while driving a manual transmission. Not an easy task. 

I waddled in to the house and cried, then took a stone cold shower to clean myself up. 

I think that may have been one of the worst days of my life.",1,toxic,0.002

Part of what I did involved driving trucks, including the occasional long distance drive, and it wasn't uncommon for me to get high *while* driving. Literally, steering 60 tonnes of truck with a J in my mouth. I never had an accident while driving, and I was never caught, because I was never tested. 

There was random drug testing carried out on my base, but these tests had to have transport pre-booked so that if anyone tested positive in the field test, their sample could be taken directly to pathology for confirmatory testing. Because I worked in transport, I could see when these were booked and made sure to be somewhere off-base at that time.

I wasn't the only one. At least half of the guys I worked with were the same. At one point, I was buying from my own sergeant, who was buying off a military police sergeant. Later, when his MP sergeant/dealer was busted, I introduced my sergeant to a guy I knew.

I asked him if study of Zen and meditation would help and his answer was ""Gee, I dunno, but I will tell you that if you meditate and study Zen long enough, in time........you just won't mind"".   
Liked the response and started. Every day.   
Its been 51 years of daily meditation and I haven't missed a day.   
Its been a real help in my life in a lot of ways.   
Oh, and the hand shaking went away in two weeks after I started to meditate, and never returned. 

In Zen we don't really care much about rebirth or reincarnation. Its a feature but we don't spend much time thinking about it. We do discipline ourselves to learn to focus on the present, as that is the only place where change happens. You can forget the past, its gone.......and you can plan for but don't have to worry much about the future, because its unknowable and never happens the way you think it will. 

You are right about the rebirth aspect.   
There is no Creator God in Buddhism, so there is no heaven or hell or sin.

How familiar are you really with Galileo?


Galileo, was right in his conclusion. He was wrong in his science, literally. It's kind of funny he is ironically held up by atheists often. 


As you see the Pope actually summoned him and liked his ideas. The Pope asked him to right the ideas etc. 


Those who disagreed with him were the scientists far more than clergy. And in truth, his science was wrong. 


The scientific consensus was that Galileo was wrong. At the time then, by the same metrics used by today to declare what is truth, Galileo was a pseudo science charlatan. And the other scientists pooed on him. 


Galileo then basically became a disgruntled scientist and:


>tells the story in such a way to make the other person look like an idiot. 


That's when he got in trouble. 


The fault of the Pope was actually in that the Pope was more like a modern atheist via science, then a theist. 


The Pope was told that Galileo was debunked and that he was rowdy and spoke wrong. So the Pope told him so. Then Galileo went at the Pope (who at the time was also the King of the country that Galileo lived in etc). 


His ""house arrest"" wasn't a bars and lock down, but a banning from academia. 


Galileo is the poster child not of atheist scientists, but of everyone atheist scientists hate. 


While Galileo was literally and thus autistically wrong... he was intrinsically right. 


>Science has not discovered a purpose to life, but it makes no claim as to


Science does not really ""do"" anything other than be intrinsically correct. 


But we are humans in a lived human experience. We don't talk to ""science"", we talk to humans known as scientists. 


90? 99?% of what is termed ""science"" is not SCIENCE. The inanimate thing. But is ""the scientific consensus."" 


When defending ""science"" that is really the scientific consensus, atheists say what science, the inanimate object is, or try to. 


Interestingly, what is another set of similar words to ""the scientific consesus?"" 


""The theologian consensus."" Doesn't theology intrinsic make either does it? Everything most people know of things are the consensus, not the intrinsic thing.  


Back to the math, pemdas is not intrinsic math, it's a mathematical consensus, a language. But not math itself. 


Dude in the video, firstly it's an 18 min gee whiz. Summarizes thousands of hours of concept. The expectation of perfection is beyond a sense of the silly. 


Further, let's go back to Galileo, if Galileo was less of a ""dick"", he might have been able to be less egotistical, maybe refine his errant science to better prove his conclusions. But that's not how humans do. 


Sheldrake for instance, is a scientist, who was similarly treated to Galileo. Right or wrong, being a human, he reacted like humans do. 


Grains of salt all around, Galileo or Sheldrake, right or wrong, their earnest inquisition and thoughts are met with vitriol. In reality, by the clergy of ""science"". Aka scientists or people who proport to represent science or have power in science. 


One thing though is you notice perhaps at least some humility. In that he gives these things to a question, rather than a statement of fact. Which is what science is. But a question is not allowed often. In science intrinsic? Of course. By the ""gatekeepers?"" Errr not so much. 


Every one of his points and conclusions in terms of the intrinsic could be wrong and he wouldn't be wrong about the ""consensus"" team. 


I noted that the Bible does not say the sun was made after the earth, but rather light was. 


The general ""clergy consensus"" among Christians is that it was. They are wrong, but that doesn't mean the biblical bit there is wrong. 


Science by defintion in root can never be wrong. But it's clergy, it's adherents etc can often be quite wrong, arrogant, ego driven, hostile, violent etc. Because, they are humans, not science. 


>Or have I pegged you entirely wrong, and you're actually only 51% sure of the existence of god, souls, and angels, and you find the rest highly debatable? I don't think from what you've said that you feel that way, but I'm just making sure.


Using the modern variation of not being trapped by language, I 100% beleive in Kami... singular, plural, big, small, as my English speaker said ""a meaningless word...."" but with meaning. 


For the human mind at least, **language crafts reality, a limited language limits the reality you can have. Unlimited language afford the totality of reality.**


Hence in part the math. Unlimited math. 


They say math is ""the Universal language"" but if your math is limited by language, you may not see the Universal math from another. Meeting an alien doing math in a different math language, not just ""language"" may make you not understand the thing that should be Universal. 


>Which is to say that god exists, and that god communicates with us? Is that the only high confidence belief you take from the entire Christian cannon? Or does that also include key events like the resurrection and possibly the global flood? Does your confidence include key events from other religions, since you seem to find them compatible on some level?


Generally? Yes? Lol. 


Different levels of the % per se. Many in discernment. But also, language. 


Not being contained by limited language, a thing can be many things simultaneously in a way. 


What is a ""cool shirt."" Is it cold? Is it hip? Is it cool like party people cool? Is is cool like ""neat/mildly interesting?"" 


If you apply one of these errantly and beleive it wholly, crafting your reality, then you may think when someone proves the shirt wasn't cold... that the shirt was disproven. But, you're just lacking any understandings. 


>My main focus here is still linked to the root question of what makes someone like yourself confident not only that god exists,


As I thought you sort of touched on earlier. Perhaps the answer is:


""The study of everything."" 


There is no answer, there is all the answers. There is the totality of reality? Every science, every discipline, every philosophy, every concept. None in isolation, but the whole of it put together. 


Limited language or limited things, are... necessarily limited. They are necessarily incomplete, lacking in the whole. 


To seek an isolated or even small answer to the totality of all things, is a nonsequitor is it not? Is not the answer to the totality of all things, the totality of all things? 


If an apple in the end is only truly known by knowing an apple, how else could we know of the total without knowing as much of the total as possible?

""I haven't seen you in a minute!"", what does that phrase mean? ""I have not seen you in 60 seconds""????? 


It techncially could, but it in all use has always meant ""I haven't seen you in a long time."" 


The question is good here, a ""global"" flood. I lean toward such, yes. But it's not really required outside of that pesky autism. A large flood would fit the mold. 


The autistic would require 60 seconds of unseen. The human understands that the minute is not 60 seconds. Maybe, sometimes it is, but it is not actually intrinsic to it. 


As I said too, Kami, Elohim, etc were all translated later into different words in different places with more autistic languages, more limited language models, more crafting models. 


To understand how people speak... kind of like I mentioned both Biden and Trump, they speak Archaic. And thus they are no longer understood in some (many) circles. Even when not just falsely misunderstood due to division. They speak more human, we do not anymore. So what is anything when a human speaks? And what is it when a robot speaks? They are not the same. And the religions known to man are in human speak. ",1,toxic,0.006

Live in staff are going to be significantly more costly in the US. Don't expect to get any button that good for under $80,000 a year. So if you're thinking you're going to need a whole system of them you're easily going to spend a million a year on staff. 

To give context, my boss employs about 50 full-time non-security staff. Collectively this is about 20 million a year in payroll.

I will repeat. Right-wing media are not honest actors about what the Democrats do/think/want. CNN is right-wing media. Using them as a source as if they are somehow tapped into the Democratic machine despite consistently downplaying Trump and overplaying anything even remotely resembling a scandal from Democrats to keep the horse race going is consistent evidence of this.

Basically the issue here is, you THINK you're getting word from ""Democratic insiders"" when in reality you're just listening to what the right-wing say about Democrats, which is really the biggest problem within the American electorate in general. Right-wing media flood the zone with so much bullshit and encompass so much across the spectrum that there effectively is no real ""Democratic"" media or any media that accurately represents Democrats because even the ones the right call ""left-wing"" media are actually owned, operated by and dictated to BY the right-wing.

One of the biggest cons the right has managed over the last 30-40 years is convincing people that they're somehow the underdog in the media when in fact they've always either through manipulation or outright control been able to essentially give conservatives the advantage of play in any conversation, and what that ultimately translates to is that dishonesty I mentioned. One of the greatest and most common lies from the right is that the left dominate the media and the conversation.",1,toxic,0.002
mq3n4mr,politics,jewish_insider,"Here is the beginning of the story:

Speaking on Wednesday at an event organized by the Vandenberg Coalition, Sen. Jim Banks (R-IN) attempted to lay out a middle path forward for conservative foreign policy balancing elements of the internationalism that has long dominated the party and the more restrictionist sentiments that have been ascendant in the Trump era.

The first-term Indiana senator argued that the U.S. has critical interests in the Middle East, in countering the threat from Iran and supporting Israel, even as he leaned into elements of President Donald Trump’s foreign policy that are controversial among Republican traditionalists. He framed that policy as a return to a Reaganite peace through strength approach.

Banks said that the U.S. “cannot accept another bad deal with Iran,” adding that he does not believe Trump would be interested in returning to a deal similar to the Obama-era Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.

Iran, Banks argued, is its weakest position in decades and “the president knows that he holds all the cards, and he knows how to play them. He is also the most pro-Israel president that we’ve ever had, so I fully expect him to put America and Israel’s interests first when it comes to dealing with Iran.”",1,toxic,0.001

mq3oi46,AskReddit,AdelleDeWitt,"Cool, I am also autistic and my kid is autistic and I've been teaching special ed for 20 years. I've seen people try to force kids to eat foods or even just taste them and I maintain this is abusive. Offering the child the food? Yes. I make it available and I make it available more than once. If my daughter absolutely hates the food, it's still available. It might be on a different plate so it doesn't contaminate the food that she is comfortable eating, but I continue to make it available so that she can try it when she's comfortable. Forcing her to try it when she's not comfortable would not be helpful or okay, and the experts that work with kids who have difficulty eating food would not recommend forcing them to have three bites. Haven't been there so I can see it. When they're comfortable seeing it they can smell it. If they're comfortable smelling it they can lick it as a next step.

mq3ok15,AskReddit,greencrustacean2,"I was a juror for a child molestation case. It was the first case the county heard after Covid, so it was in 2021 I think. The child’s mother molested her kid at the direction of her boyfriend who was in the other room on FaceTime telling her what to do. They showed the FaceTime video in court. It was the worst thing I’ve ever seen.

The boyfriend was the one on trial. I think the mom was also put on trial, separately. The lawyer for the boyfriend was making the case that his client did not actually commit the act, so he should not be prosecuted. You could tell the lawyer was not supportive of that fact but was trying to do his job.

Myself and the rest of the jurors were in agreement to convict life in prison. I think we deliberated for only about an hour. I thought about this case for weeks, couldn’t sleep, and would randomly cry. I couldn’t close my eyes without seeing that video.

The way cases work in the county it was in, was you had to serve as a juror for a couple months. So you would basically be on call for a couple months for whatever trials they needed jurors for. I felt like I couldn’t try to move on from what I saw and heard in since I could be called in to hear about something else terrible. I got a therapist to write a note to the judge saying I could not serve on any more juries because I was traumatized from the one I had just served on. Luckily the judge granted my request.

The case was absolutely horrible and I’ve been terrified to be chosen on a jury ever since. Also, since I couldn’t stop thinking about the case in the weeks after the trial, I googled more information about the case and discovered that the child had died. I’m not sure what happened or if it was a result of why the boyfriend was on trial. I do remember seeing a bunch of people outside the courtroom wearing t shirts with the child’s face, like in protest or something and I didn’t know what it was about until after the fact researching this case online. 

I’m glad I was apart of putting someone that horrible away forever. But it was definitely very rough and I still think about that child and the people who cared about him.",1,toxic,0.003

mq3omef,politics,RainyRobin,"Puberty blockers are routinely given to cisgender children who have precocious puberty.   
  
As you said you are hoping to be a future doctor, I'd encourage you to look up the history of their use, studies regarding the safety of prescribing them, and then consider whether the decision to deny access to this same kind of care to transgender children (who otherwise might undergo permanent changes during an uninterrupted puberty that they have to live with for the rest of their life and may need to seek more intensive medical care for, while knowing it was all very preventable) is really based on a neutral and non-biased desire for the patient to have a happy outcome.

If you approach this from a place of ""all children are Cisgender until they are 18 and mature enough to become Transgender"" then, that approach might make sense. But, that places a bias on the kid turning out to be cisgender being the ""preferred"" or ""best"" outcome. I'd question if that is really a neutral position to take or a stance that will lead to the least amount of harm. Shouldn't a truly unbiased stance be to help the patient without judgement or coercion, only focusing on their quality of life and not your preferred outcome for their gender identity?

As a transgender person who went through an unwanted puberty, it sure felt harmful. There's changes that happen to you that you can never undo, and while it is still possible to survive and thrive anyway after transitioning later it's pretty rare to meet a transitioned person who doesn't regret not having access to this kind of care during their teenage years.

I'd agree that puberty blockers shouldn't be the first gender affirming care provided. Letting them play with names, clothes, hairstyles and such is probably the best first line of exploration and doesn't require a doctor. But, if they feel strongly enough to want to go a step farther and use a puberty blocker to hold off vocal changes or growing breasts they don't want? It's probably better to let the kid explore their feelings. If they're actually cisgender? Then they can just stop taking them, and things will proceed as they would have. Maybe they'll have learned something about themselves from the experience. If they're trans? They'll probably persist until they are 18 and choose gender affirming hormone therapy at that time.",1,toxic,0.056

If your ""love"" has-always-been/will-always-be rooted in a power dynamic instead of, say, kindness and understanding. Idt true love can grow. 

I think a lot of people ~think~ they love or are in love. But in reality, it's actually just a very strong attachment. If you've never felt love, you wouldn't know the difference b/n love and a strong attachment. 

Ergo, many people walk around assuming they know love, love others, and others love them. When in reality, they're walking around having never known love or loved a person. 

Western society is rooted in power structures. The rich are allowed to exploit the poor. The whites are allowed to exploit the ppl of color. The men are allowed to exploit the women. The parents are allowed to exploit the children. The police are allowed to exploit the community. The bosses are allowed to exploit the workers. Etc etc etc.

Do you believe that all of this thinking is tossed out the window when we meet someone we are told we should love? It isn't. But we are told that we should love X. So when we feel strongly attached, we exclaim ""love!""

Fascists have been trying to take over the U.S. almost since the inception of Fascism.

In 1933 Fascists plotted to overthrow the U.S. government and replace the President with a Dictator.  [The Business Plot (1933)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Plot)

>""When and if fascism comes to America it will not be labeled 'made in Germany'; it will not be marked with a swastika; it will not even be called fascism; it will be called, of course, 'Americanism.'"" - Halford E. Luccock (1938)

>The symptoms of fascist thinking are colored by environment and adapted to immediate circumstances. But always and everywhere they can be identified by their appeal to prejudice and by the desire to play upon the fears and vanities of different groups in order to gain power. It is no coincidence that the growth of modern tyrants has in every case been heralded by the growth of prejudice. It may be shocking to some people in this country to realize that, without meaning to do so, they hold views in common with Hitler when they preach discrimination against other religious, racial or economic groups. Likewise, many people whose patriotism is their proudest boast play Hitler's game by retailing distrust of our Allies and by giving currency to snide suspicions without foundation in fact.

>The American Fascists are most easily recognized by their deliberate perversion of truth and fact. Their newspapers and propaganda carefully cultivate every fissure of disunity, every crack in the common front against fascism. They use every opportunity to impugn democracy. They use isolationism as a slogan to conceal their own selfish imperialism.

>They cultivate hate and distrust [of allies]. They claim to be super-patriots, but they would destroy every liberty guaranteed by the Constitution. They demand free enterprise, but are the spokesmen for monopoly and vested interest. Their final objective toward which all their deceit is directed is to capture political power so that, using the power of the State and the power of the market simultaneously they may keep the common man in eternal subjection. - Henry A. Wallace, Vice President, USA, 1944.

Absolutely false. ML cannot simulate large molecules to ""quantum mechanic accuracy"". It can't do it for small molecules either, for that matter. It can in some cases be *good enough* ***on average*** to be useful when dealing with a large library of compounds, but for an individual case where DFT-level accuracy is needed, ML is useless. 

I am assuming by ""quantum mechanic accuracy"" you mean that it is able to predict differences in energy of the same order of magnitude that DFT is capable of calculating which is absurd. 

If you instead mean that it is able to make qualitative predictions of certain systems with the same level of reliability as DFT, then that is more defensible, although in all these cases the differences in energy that it needs to accurately differentiate are several orders of magnitude larger than what DFT is capable of calculating, but these systems do not require anywhere near that level of precision for the predictions to be useful.",1,toxic,0.001

mq3p4op,AskReddit,SofiiaSam,"Finally I can tell my experience somewhere. 
I was living in black out for one and half month. No electricity, no water, no internet and war outside on the streets. So here what I did:
1. The first thing I was doing is going to the cafes, that had generators. I was studying at that time (first year of medical university) and I had to download videos from the lectures. There were also days when I had online lectures and I was sitting in the cafe all day without buying anything. Also I was charging my laptop, phone, iPad, even my old iPod and 2 old phones and three power banks.
2. We didn’t have water. So it was almost impossible to take a shower. In my country in sleeping districts there are always places, where you can pour water for free. So I was staying in a queues with three 2 liter bottles and my parents too every two days. after this we could take shower a little bit (every day) and wash hair (once in 3 days).
3. I put all of my money from the cards. There were situations when I couldn’t pay with card (because of no electricity in some supermarkets or cafes) and my phone could also die in any moment so I have to be sure I will be able to pay in any moment. 
4. I deleted TikTok and some other social medias and also I stopped listening to music if I there is no charger next to me. 
5. I bought six flashlights (for me and my parents). I was always going back after Uni around 5 or 6 pm so it was always dark. So I was always turning on it when I was walking back home
6. I bought Thermal underwear. We had black out in the beginning of the winter and it was always -2 or -10 degrees. This underwear was always in my bag so I would be cold I could dress up
7. Food. Fortunately my grandma had two cookers, that could work without socket. We were buying mostly food like Canned food, rice, Buckwheat and pasta.",1,toxic,0.001

Look at the cities chosen, not known for a lot of snowfall in the winter. 

They are only in pilot cities known for clear weather, because they are NOT viable for wide scale rollout. 

Also, most of those ""autonomous"" cars have people who will take over remotely when things go wrong. 

I'd also point out how many companies have dropped out of that race, realising it was throwing good money after bad to keep chasing a dream with no realistic chance of happening soon.

mq3rat0,AskReddit,sinat50,"Same thing happened to me after covid. ""Undesirsable"" was the word that kept playing through my head. I live in a ski town and couldn't get a girl if my life depended on it, which felt exceptionally bad since people hookup like crazy in ski towns. 

Decided to just stop caring and trying, and to just enjoy my hobbies of skiing and music production. Spent a couple years just focusing on myself and I wouldn't trade that time for all the sex in the world. I became better at producing music and started tackling more intense terrain on my skis. Everyday I did those two things, I felt good about myself and started to really appreciate who I am and what I could do. 

Last year I was having a bad day and wanted to ride a chairlift alone but a huge group of drunk Swedish guys started coming through the line. There was a girl about to get on so I asked if I could join her. We talked on the way up and I though she seemed cool so I asked if we could go for a lap. She said yes, we had a fun line down the mountain, but I was working at the time so I had to leave to get some stuff done. At the end of the day I came back to that chair and told myself if I saw her again I'd ask for her number. Just as I'm about to take off from the top of the chair, I see her hop off so I skied over and asked if I could get her number. She said yes and we've been together ever since.

Love yourself. That's the best advice I can give. Don't wait around for someone to love you and make you feel wanted. Find a hobby or two, develop a skill, get a different haircut, get a tattoo, just do anything for you and only you. If you can't love yourself, how are you supposed to love someone else? If you can't be happy by yourself, how are you going to be happy with someone else?",1,unknown,0.994

They ended up being extremely apologetic (via the one guy who spoke English) and sent some booze into our kareoke booth.

(That's what kicked it off -- I tried to ask to bum a cigarrette off someone coming out of the bathroom)

I guess it used to be a thing that the bald dudes would get into fights and it was to the point folks would straight up jump a guy out after curfew because hey, what are you gonna do, call the cops? They'll tell the base you were out.

I was standing outside a bar when I saw him, B, in the arms of a friend, A. I approached. A grabbed me and told him ""hey, you should kiss her too"".

He did. From memory, it was a fine first kiss for two drunk people.

The night continued without major incident, romantic or otherwise. The details are lost to time and alcohol.

A few months later, A and I started dating. B and A remained good friends, as do B and I, but everyone decides not to pursue anything romantic.

Seven years later, A and I broke up. It sucked.

A year after that, B asked me out. I said yes.

I have never known love like it. I would punch Satan in the mouth for hurting him. He makes me want to be a better person. He makes me want to have babies, for Christ's sake.

I asked him about the first time we met, and, with a little coaxing, he admitted that he'd held a torch for me ever since that first kiss.

We can execute nearly arbitrary code on the human operating system now.  We can produce enough energy to power the massive compute needed to understand potential interactions between sequences of chemically modified mRNA with native sequences and molecules, customizing treatments with LNPs made with nanostructured lipids and conjugated sugars designed to target specific organs systems, tissue types, and cells.

Need to regrow your teeth?  Have a little injection of some 18 month slow release recursive mRNA that stores in an endosomr and slowly releases sequences that produce USAG1 inhibiting antibodies or BMP/WNT1 promoters.

Want to cure your kid’s Down Syndrome?  Inject some mRNA in LNP that generates sequence specific guide-RNA that methylates out the extra chromosome in all tissues.

Want to moderate your inherited CSD?  LNPs containing mRNA or gRNA which targets the SNP and recruits ADAR1 to edit the adenosine to inosine.

Need a little more muscle mass?  Have a slow release mRNA that increases follistatin and human growth hormone.

I didn’t cope very well, but it was more than just the alcoholism. It was the poverty, the violence around me, the housing insecurity, everything. I grew up too soon, I gained a lot of anxiety. I’m very much a worrier and a planner and always have been.

The biggest ways it’s affected me as adult are: general anxiety and alcohol-self-consciousness. I’m not a big drinker, but I often find myself worrying that I’m an alcoholic. Naturally, that makes me drink less, which gives me a comically low tolerance. Which leads to shame when I accidentally get drunk with friends after having literally one or two drinks over the course of hours. Thankfully, I am a very euphoric drunk- so these issues kind of just make me *more* fun at parties. 

I easily could’ve died in a drunk driving car accident as a kid, I could’ve grown up in the system, etc etc etc, so my little shame spirals around alcohol are not much to complain about. Mom has been sober for years and years now. Parents, if you’re getting sober please let your kids be the reason, but don’t let your kids be your entire support system.",1,unknown,0.999

I do think Clinton would've won had she been a man, but also she had a 30 year smear campaign against her that predates society being more open to the idea of a woman leading. I think people had a sexist bias against her without realizing - people who may not have had it if she hadn't been famous in the 90s.

And Harris was basically a cop. And tried to do respectability politics.

I don't think either of them felt relatable in our current climate - partly bc they're women but also partly bc they're pressured to be so professional and take the ""high road"" and control their emotions. AOC being rightfully angry is much more inviting for people.

That said, I do think a man would have a better chance. It's dumb but I do agree with that. I just don't think Hillary Clinton and Harris losing are proof that we COULDNT elect a woman in the near future.

I even remember seeing people early on wearing masks and I was confused because that’s explicitly against what the government was telling us. 

Once supply caught up with demand Fauci predictably advised masks as a way to protect people from COVID. Then (around late April to May) the federal government (and democratic state governments) pivoted and essentially demanded extreme mask policies. While the intent was obviously intended to reduce spread many conservatives took the initial words of Fauci as an example of hypocrisy and non transparency. About a month or so in after the March lockdowns (when the real effects started hitting the economy) instability rose in both red and blue states. I also think the fact that most people were stuck at home in echo chambers with nothing to do lead to the various outbursts. 

In red states that manifested itself in anti-covid demonstrations, anti federal demonstrations (and riots- there were multiple seizures of state capitols and other administrative buildings, January 6th was just the biggest one). Blue states in turn started rioting over the George Floyd death and general opposition to the Trump administration. I think Portland reached 100 days of rioting at one point. In Seattle there was a de facto anarchist organization occupying the downtown as well for a decent while. All in all the summer of 2020 was very unstable. After Trump lost the election instability increased again but mostly on the right. People in general were angry and Conservatives vented their grievances through ignoring Covid policies (which they viewed as un-transparent and anti-libertarian as it infringed on their personal liberties)",1,unknown,0.998

I am among the many that could have forgiven some folks (not all) after the first election of trump...so, so many people just don't pay attention & make slap decisions without information.

The real trick is to get people who, in my opinion are too entitled to bother to pay attention, to pay attention.

I remember a few other strange things from my childhood that I just couldn't wrap my head around. Completely normal according to my parents...

Since I had a child myself 13 years ago, I started to realise things like that were never about safety or logic, but about control and dominance.

Not allowing me any privacy or autonomy weren't even 'about me', but purely about their need for access, control, and a sense of power.

I wasn't allowed to have an inner world of my own, because that inner world posed a potential threat in  which they defined the norm.

It didn't stop when I left home at 18...

Later in life, I started realizing that whenever my mother claimed to “help” me, it wasn’t actually about helping—it was about control.
One time, I was moving to a new place. I had planned everything carefully and booked a moving truck myself.
Behind my back, she canceled the truck and decided that my family would help me move instead. She rearranged everything without telling me, and I only found out through my sister.

Military service doesn't appeal to the best types of people.  In fact, because it's a financial lifeline, it actually ends up attracting people with low future prospects, usually the kind that had broken homes and such.

Not to say everyone is from the dregs, but rather, the 'bottom of the barrel' is over-represented in the military.  And not to say all those people are crappy, but there are plenty of crappy people in that group who subscribe to the ""if I can take it, I will"", because they're used to having nothing, and nothing to lose.

We then ship all these people off to basic training, where we basically brainwash them.  Breaking them down, conditioning them to be more functional as soldiers, as a team, and good at following orders.  This is great for if they see combat, but these things don't help them as much during peacetime.  And we don't even bother to pound into their brains better ethics for how they interact with civilians.  Which is the first real failing point (since we can't really change WHO joins the military).

After basic, we put these people in situations that only heighten their urges.  Fraternizing with the coeds is highly taboo, ten times worse if there's a rank difference.  So the only chance of getting some action is when you leave the base.  Which functions as the double-whammy of not getting any, and then having small windows of time to get laid.  Which, for a personality that defines their life at least in part around getting to fuck, is a ticking time bomb waiting to go off.  Even worse when that person is surrounded by similar people.

Not to excuse Wedington at all.  But maybe, in addition to punishing him, our military should consider proper ethics training for their recruits, especially the ones who are serving abroad.  And/or providing other outlets that are less risky (either for the civilians, or for the servicemen & women).

Yep- though it doesn't detract from the point, but is a way to view it- does the demand of white children outpace their supply, meaning a bias against parents wanting nonwhite children?

I think it comes down to economics. Due to racial biases and opportunity of thr past, white people are more likely to be wealthy on average than most minorities.

Poor parents are more likely to give up their children for adoption due to not having the means to support them (disproportionate supply of minority children) and wealthy family's are more likely to be doing the adopting due to the 10,000+$ adoption fee and willingness to provide for a child (disproportionately white parents).

Maybe the claim is that it's racism that parents want to adopt a child that looks like them? I don't really think so. Parents just want a child similar to themselves for a number of reasons, thinking children of different races are 'lesser' doesn't factor into it for the vast majority. I'm sure minority couples seek adoption for their own race as well, it's just that the proportion of supply and demand for adoptable children and adopting parents is skewed in the ways I described.",1,unknown,0.994
